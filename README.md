# samsung-data-challenge
Source codes used for Samsung Data Challenge 2018 as team Campfire.
Given the data collection of car accidents (`train_kor.csv`), we are asked to fill out datas with missing entries (`test_kor.csv`).

We used NN for qualification round (`./qual`) and XGBoost for final round (`./final`).
